A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE place with your ADJECTIVE family.
Usually you go to some place that is near a/an NOUN or up on a/an NOUN .
A good vacation place is one where you can ride PLURAL_NOUN or VERB in a/an VERB_IN_ING pool .
I like to spend my time VERB_IN_ING or VERB_IN_ING .
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating fancy PLURAL_NOUN , playing NOUN , or sitting around and VERB_IN_ING .
Last year on vacation, my little brother fell in a/an NOUN and got poison PLANT all over his BODY_PART .
My family is going to go to (the) PLACE , and I will learn to VERB .
Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very ADJECTIVE and because they have to work NUMBER hours every day all year making enough PLURAL_NOUN to pay for the vacation.
